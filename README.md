### Hi there üëã

I am currently developing **mostly for iOS** with some Django on the side. I write a (mostly iOS focused) [blog](https://nemecek.be/) and I am trying to be active in the iOS Dev community - by helping folks, sharing stories with [iOS Chat interviews](https://nemecek.be/chats/) üí¨ and more. 

ü§ù Happy to help with Swift and iOS in general (UIKit though).

üõ† **Recent projects** include [iOS Feeds](https://iosfeeds.com/) which indexes community blog posts, videos and podcast episodes. Check it out if you are looking for new content about iOS Dev. I also have [similar one](https://djangofeeds.com/) for Django.
